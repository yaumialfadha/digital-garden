# 👋 Welcome

Hi there, and thanks for stopping by!  
This site is my **digital garden**, a place where I collect and share notes, ideas, and learnings around **DevOps, Infrastructure, and Cloud Engineering**.

---

## 🚀 What You’ll Find Here

I write about topics I encounter in my daily work as a DevOps engineer:

- **Kubernetes & Containerization** – deployments, networking, troubleshooting, and best practices.  
- **CI/CD Pipelines** – GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Bitbucket Pipelines, and ArgoCD.  
- **Observability** – monitoring with Prometheus, Grafana, New Relic, and Datadog.  
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** – Terraform, Helm, and automation workflows.  
- **Cloud Platforms** – Google Cloud (GCP), AWS, and Alibaba Cloud.  
- **Security & Networking** – RBAC, policies, and keeping infra safe & scalable.

## 🌱 Why a Digital Garden?

Unlike a blog, this site is not just about polished “finished” articles.  
Instead, it’s a **living collection of notes**—continuously updated as I learn new things, experiment with tools, and improve existing practices.  

Think of it as my **second brain** for DevOps.
